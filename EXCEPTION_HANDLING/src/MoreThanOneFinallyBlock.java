/*Question:Can we have more than one finally block ?
 In most programming languages that support 
 exception handling, such as Java, you cannot
  have more than one finally block associated 
  with a single try block. Each try block can have 
  at most one finally block, which will execute 
  regardless of whether an exception was thrown or 
  caught.However, you can nest try blocks within 
  each other, and each nested try block can have 
  its own finally block.*/
